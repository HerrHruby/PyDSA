Welcome to PyDSALib's documentation!
======================================

Introduction
----------------

PyDSALib is a data structures library, written in Python for Python. It aims to provide an efficient implementation and a convenient interface for each data structure, as well as a selection of useful methods and algorithms to manipulate them.
 
PyDSALib is still very much in development - see the TODO section. We welcome open-source contributions to help improve this library.
