- URGENT: Unit testing for ALL modules
- Improve documentation:
  - Include module docstrings for all modules
  - Provide examples of use for every module
  - Formatting
- Create tutorials

- Rewrite binary_tree to use stack instead of recursion, to improve scalability
- Create a vector (in the maths sense) class for efficient vector manipulation?
- Implement delete method for AVL_tree
- Graph pretty printer (quite challenging)
