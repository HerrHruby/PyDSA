# PyDSL
A library of data structures, implemented in Python for Python

Construction in progress

The current repo contains classes for queue, stack, deque, linked list, 
binary tree and self-balancing (AVL) binary tree. 

It seems AVL tree is buggy. Everything else should work.

TODO: add graph class, vector class, priority queue interface. Testing, code reformatting and commenting, packaging, documentation...
